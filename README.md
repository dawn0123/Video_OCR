## API

```python
videocr.get_subtitles(
        video_path: str, lang='eng', time_start='0:00', time_end='',
        conf_threshold=65, sim_threshold=90, use_fullframe=False)
```
Return the subtitles string in SRT format.


```python

videocr.save_subtitles_to_file(
        video_path: str, file_path='subtitle.srt', lang='eng', time_start='0:00',
        time_end='', conf_threshold=65, sim_threshold=90, use_fullframe=False)
```
Write subtitles to `file_path`. If the file does not exist, it will be created automatically.

## Adjustable Parameters

- `lang`

  Language of the subtitles in the video. 

- `time_start` and `time_end`

  Extract subtitles from only a part of the video. The subtitle timestamps are still calculated according to the full video length.

- `conf_threshold`

  Confidence threshold for word predictions. Words with lower confidence than this threshold are discarded. The default value is fine for most cases. 

  Make it closer to 0 if you get too few words from the predictions, or make it closer to 100 if you get too many excess words.

- `sim_threshold`

  Similarity threshold for subtitle lines. Neighbouring subtitles with larger [Levenshtein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) ratios than this threshold will be merged together. The default value is fine for most cases.

  Make it closer to 0 if you get too few subtitle lines, or make it closer to 100 if you get too many duplicated subtitles.

- `use_fullframe`

  By default, only the bottom half of each frame is used for OCR in order to reduce errors. You can explicitly make the algorithm handle the full frame.
